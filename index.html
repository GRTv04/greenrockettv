        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p> 
            GreenRocketTV (Grtv) began its journey in 2019, fueled by a passion for creativity and storytelling. What started as a group of friends making funny skits and YouTube content soon turned into something much bigger. As we started gaining traction and recognition, we felt like we were truly getting into the game. But then, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, forcing us to pause our work. Instead of giving up, we dreamed bigger—we knew we needed a studio workspace to take our craft to the next level. So, we took a leap of faith, pooled all our resources, and started building our studio in Ramhlun South.
            With the unwavering love and support from our friends and audience, we hit a major milestone in 2021, receiving our first Silver Play Button from YouTube. From that point on, there was no looking back. We expanded into filmmaking, music videos, advertisements, and collaborations with big brands. Our passion pushed us to work 24/7, capturing life’s most meaningful moments through photography—weddings, events, and even funerals—while also diving deep into art, designing, and selling our own creations. To bring a full production experience, we established our sound department, offering recording and mixing services to complete our creative vision.
            At Grtv, we believe in collaboration, dedication, and supporting small businesses and startups. In 2023, we achieved one of our biggest dreams—producing our first feature film, Rawng Chawhpawlh, a classic cult film reflecting our society and lifestyle. The film was submitted to various festivals, receiving multiple selections and recognition.
            Today, our main work includes advertisement videos, event coverage, wedding and event photography, filmmaking, and art. We continue to push boundaries, tell stories that matter, and create content that inspires. This is just the beginning.</p>
